Started as some common tooling around OPNSense, then my autism got the better of me, and I decided to make it more generic.

### Setup OPNSense
`System > Access > Users` in the Commands table export API keys.

### Setup Proxmox
Use username and password for authentication.

### Todo
- [ ] Use a common logger
- [ ] Move json debug tooling from OPNSense to util folder
